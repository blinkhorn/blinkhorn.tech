In my last post from March 2018, I was in the midst of learning Java Spring. A lot has changed in the last year.

Shortly after that post, I started work on The Buffalo Group's DEEA contract, where I was part of a team building Angular applications for the DIA. While I was on that contract, I also had the chance to work in Python and Java to build serialization/deserialization programs for [JSON ISM](https://github.com/DoDCIO/json-ism) objects.

In March of this year, I moved on from The Buffalo Group and started working for Mythics on a contract with the Department of Energy. At this time, I'm on a website modernization project at The Department of Energy.

Outside of my day job, I've been honing my PHP and React skills in addition to studying for the AWS Certified Developer - Associate Level exam, which I aim to take and pass by the end of the year. I will be posting blog posts about my experience learning AWS over the coming weeks.

On a more personal note, my wife and I had a small wedding this past November and we are enjoying married life.

If you're curious as to what I've been up to musically, I have an ambient album coming out with [Outputmessage](https://www.outputmessage.com/) under our Smoke & Tea alias later this year. I've also continued with techno and house music under my [Blinkhorn](https://soundcloud.com/blinkhorn) moniker. You can listen to my latest release from March 2019 [here](https://blinkhorn.bandcamp.com/album/meat-market-ep).
