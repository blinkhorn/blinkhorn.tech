In January of my senior year at Colby College, I was a music teacher assistant at Warsaw Middle School in Pittsfield, Maine. My experience in that classroom was very positive — I grew both professionally and personally.

I didn't end up up going down the career path of a music educator as was my plan back then — I'm now enjoying my work as a senior software engineer — but I still value my degree in music, what I learned from my instructors at Colby, and my experience as a music teacher assistant at Warsaw Middle School. While I'm not using much music theory, conducting skills, or many other aspects of my music degree at work or in [my own music](https://blinkhorn.bandcamp.com/) anymore, I believe there's a reason why I find many other fellow musicians in the tech industry, particularly in engineering: music demands a propensity for abstract thought, which is a valuable skill to have as a software engineer. There are other characteristics musicians have that help us excel as software engineers, such as a dedication to practice in developing a skill, but I'd like to underscore that musicians' readiness for abstract thought is a strength we bring to the table.
