I'm a Silver Spring, MD based AWS certified full-stack software engineer working as a tech lead at NRECA. I have been developing software full-time since 2018 at companies across a wide range of industries, most recently working at Capital One, FiscalNote, and roles as a government consultant earlier on.

After earning my bachelor's degree in music from Colby College, I served for ten months as a corps member with AmeriCorps NCCC FEMA Corps. On my team of nine young adults, I was the Assistant Team Leader, the Vehicle, Safety, and Tools Coordinator, the Life After AmeriCorps Representative, and the Physical Training Point of Contact.

While serving with FEMA Corps, I became interested in programming and other aspects of computer science. I was always passionate about technology, but it wasn't until my service with FEMA Corps that I started teaching myself programming languages. I took courses in computer science at Northern Virginia Community College (Alexandria Campus) and Georgetown University before completing an immersive coding bootcamp at General Assembly to learn the latest industry relevant technologies.
