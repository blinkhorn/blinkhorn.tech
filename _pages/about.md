I'm a Silver Spring, MD based AWS certified senior software engineer with Capital One. I previously worked as a software engineer for Roll Call, which is a FiscalNote company, as a junior full stack developer with Mythics, where I was on a project at The Department of Energy, and as a software/web developer at The Buffalo Group in Reston, VA, where I programmed in Angular, Python, and Java. I graduated from the Web Development Immersive (WDI) program at General Assembly in Washington, DC.

After earning my bachelor's degree in music from Colby College in 2013, I served for ten months as a corps member with AmeriCorps NCCC FEMA Corps. On my team of nine young adults, I was the Assistant Team Leader, the Vehicle, Safety, and Tools Coordinator, the Life After AmeriCorps Representative, and the Physical Training Point of Contact.

While serving with FEMA Corps, I became interested in programming and other aspects of computer science. I was always passionate about technology, but it wasn't until my service with FEMA Corps that I started teaching myself programming languages. I took courses in computer science at Northern Virginia Community College (Alexandria Campus) and Georgetown University before joining the WDI18 Cohort at General Assembly in August of 2017.
